#Spatial Data of Municipalities (Maps)

 Spatial Data of Municipalities (Maps) sourced from different government websites which are freely available to all the Indians. Here we have digitized them, cleaned them, added appropriate attributes so it can be used by all the researchers, students etc

All the municipality boundaries are available in geojson (WGS84, EPSG4326) format. The below table gives you the city of the data as we clean and upload. Data is not perfect there as many errors both in data and boundaries. You can contribute by sending the pull requests. Refer [CONTRIBUTING](/contributing) for ways to contribute.
